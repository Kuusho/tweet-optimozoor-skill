  # Algorithm-specific pitfalls
  - id: candidate-isolation-misunderstanding
    severity: high
    title: "Candidates can't see each other during ranking"
    description: |
      The Phoenix ranking model uses "special attention masking so candidates
      cannot attend to each other." This means your tweet is scored in isolation.

      IMPLICATION: Riding trending topics or quote-tweeting viral content
      doesn't directly boost your score. Your content must stand alone.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "quote tweet this viral post"
      - "hop on this trend"
      - "ride the wave"
    fix: |
      Focus on intrinsic content quality. Trending topics help discovery
      but don't inflate your ranking score directly.

  - id: author-diversity-penalty
    severity: high
    title: "Posting frequency hurts individual post reach"
    description: |
      The Author Diversity Scorer "attenuates repeated author scores to ensure
      feed diversity." Posting 10 tweets in an hour means each gets suppressed.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "let me post multiple times"
      - "post a thread as separate tweets"
      - "post every hour"
    fix: |
      Space out posts. Quality over quantity. A single banger beats
      five mid tweets. Threads are fine (they're one unit), but
      separate standalone posts should be spaced 2-4 hours apart.

  - id: negative-signal-cascade
    severity: critical
    title: "Single report/block cascades harder than you think"
    description: |
      Negative signals (block, mute, report) carry very high negative weights.
      The model learns from these signals across your entire account history.
      One viral-for-bad-reasons tweet can tank future reach.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "controversial take"
      - "rage bait"
      - "make people angry"
    fix: |
      Controversy should make people reply, not block. Test: "Would someone
      share this to their timeline?" vs "Would someone screenshot this
      to mock you?" Only the first is good engagement.

  - id: link-in-first-tweet-penalty
    severity: medium
    title: "External links reduce initial distribution"
    description: |
      Links trigger P(click) but also signal "this is promotional content"
      which correlates with P(not_interested). The algorithm learned this pattern.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "check out my link"
      - "link in tweet"
      - "click here"
    fix: |
      Hook first, link later. Post the value-add tweet, let it gain
      traction, then reply with the link. Or use "link in bio" only
      after the content proves engaging.

  - id: hashtag-spam-detection
    severity: medium
    title: "Multiple hashtags signal low-quality content"
    description: |
      The model has learned that tweets with 3+ hashtags correlate with
      P(not_interested) and P(mute_author). Organic viral content rarely
      uses hashtags because the content speaks for itself.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "#startup #entrepreneur #grind"
      - "multiple hashtags"
      - "add relevant hashtags"
    fix: |
      Zero to one hashtag max. If your content needs hashtags to be found,
      the content isn't good enough. Hashtags are for joining specific
      conversations, not for discovery.

  - id: engagement-bait-detection
    severity: high
    title: "Explicit engagement requests backfire"
    description: |
      "RETWEET IF...", "Like if you agree", "Comment your thoughts" patterns
      have been heavily trained as spam signals. They trigger P(not_interested)
      and P(mute_author).
    trigger_patterns:
      - "retweet if"
      - "like if you agree"
      - "comment below"
      - "share this"
    fix: |
      Create content that compels engagement naturally. A genuine question
      gets replies. A hot take gets quote tweets. Never explicitly ask
      for the engagement you want.

  - id: dwell-without-payoff
    severity: medium
    title: "Dwell time only counts if there's a payoff"
    description: |
      Long tweets that don't deliver create a bad signal. The model detects
      when users read a long post and then don't engage. This trains
      P(not_interested) for bait-and-switch content.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "build up to nothing"
      - "long for the sake of long"
      - "pad the tweet"
    fix: |
      Information density matters. Every sentence should either create
      tension or release it. If you can't justify a line's existence,
      delete it.

  # Voice and authenticity pitfalls
  - id: corporate-speak-penalty
    severity: medium
    title: "Marketing language triggers mute patterns"
    description: |
      Phrases like "excited to announce", "thrilled to share", "game-changing"
      pattern-match to promotional content that users have muted repeatedly.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "excited to announce"
      - "thrilled to"
      - "game-changing"
      - "revolutionary"
    fix: |
      Write like a person texting a friend, not a press release.
      "we shipped" > "excited to announce our launch"
      "this changes everything" > "revolutionary new paradigm"

  - id: over-optimization-uncanny-valley
    severity: high
    title: "Too optimized feels fake"
    description: |
      Content that hits every optimization checkbox but lacks authentic voice
      triggers P(not_interested). Users have developed immunity to
      perfectly-structured viral bait.
    trigger_patterns:
      - "perfect hook formula"
      - "every viral trick"
      - "optimization checklist"
    fix: |
      Optimize structure, keep voice authentic. The best viral content
      breaks one rule on purpose. Leave a deliberate imperfection
      that feels human.
